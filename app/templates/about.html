        This website's purpose is to view unique, computer generated images of dogs, math symbols, or Marvel inspired superheroes. 
        The images generated on this website cannot be found on the internet and are not changes to an image already on the internet. 
        The images are generated using a fake brain/AI that uses machine learning, specifically an algorithm called ProGAN, to learn how to create original images. 
        Each image is generated by the fake brain/AI from random noise, and in the process of turning the noise into an image, no images on the internet are used.

    <p>Quick note: The Marvel inspired superheroes are not going to look like recognizable superheroes for some technical reasons but will still be cool looking</p>
